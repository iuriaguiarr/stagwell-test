# Project description

This project consists of a collection of JavaScript exercises, each addressing different concepts and common problems. The exercises have been organized into separate files, and each file represents a specific exercise.

## How to use

To use this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. If you don't have it yet, you can download and install it from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation

1. Access the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd stagwell-test
   ```

2. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Performing the Exercises

Each exercise has been organized into individual files within the `src/exercises/` folder. To run a specific exercise, you can use the command `npm run` or `yarn` followed by the exercise number. For example, to run "exercise_1.js":

```bash
npm run exercise_1
# or
yarn exercise_1
```

You can run the rest of the exercises in the same way, substituting the exercise number in the file name.

### Tests

The project includes tests to verify the correctness of some of the implemented functions. The tests were written using Jest.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

This will run all the tests defined in the test files and show the result in the terminal.
